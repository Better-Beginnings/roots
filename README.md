# Real Estate Reimagined: Open, Accessible, Unmatched.

Searching for a property can often feel like wading through a swamp of confusion.

With us, it's all about bringing you closer to your ideal property without the hassle. Enjoy a clean, user-friendly interface that gets straight to the point, presenting you with options that align with your search criteria and expectations.

## Development

### Setup

1. Clone the repo into a public GitHub repository (or fork https://github.com/Better-Beginnings/roots/fork). If you plan to distribute the code, keep the source code public to comply with [AGPLv3](https://github.com/Better-Beginnings/roots/blob/main/LICENSE).

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Better-Beginnings/roots.git
   ```

2. Go to the project folder

   ```sh
   cd roots
   ```

3. Install packages with npm

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up your `.env` file

   - Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env`

5. Setup Node
   If your Node version does not meet the project's requirements as instructed by the docs, "nvm" (Node Version Manager) allows using Node at the version required by the project:

   ```sh
   nvm use
   ```

   You first might need to install the specific version and then use it:

   ```sh
   nvm install && nvm use
   ```

   You can install nvm from [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

6. Run the project in development mode

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
